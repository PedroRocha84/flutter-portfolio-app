# flutter_portfolio_app

My first flutter app!

## Goal

This project is a starting point for my Flutter learning. 
My main goal was to learn a new open-source UI software development kit (SDK) for building multi platforms from a unique code.

We need to go over the process of build the main structure of our Flutter app and then adding data. Data in different types to start i've decided to go with:
- Text
- Images
